So to calculate the q score and num of communities. it was rather easy.

under the rich clubs in res_100, there are files for communities and modularity scores. unique(communities) for the num of communities works.

i also did the max of modularity scores for q score. can briefly talk about why max vs mean. the max modularity score is the most appropriate measure for the Q-score because it highlights the best community structure identified in each species' network. This score captures the optimal partitioning of the network, which is crucial when comparing functional complexity across species. By focusing on the best possible community division, the max modularity score provides a more meaningful insight into how effectively the brain's functional network is organized, particularly when you're examining differences across species with varying brain sizes and complexities. Using the max score ensures that you're emphasizing the most efficient and cohesive community structure for each species, whereas the mean modularity could dilute key insights by averaging out important variations and overlooking the best possible partition.

so for panel a, i wanted an exemplar functional networks for a small, medium, and large brain size mammals. so i choose the smallest, the avg, and the biggest.
it happened to be the mouse, caracal, and bottle nose dolphin. the ring in the photos is common for neuroscience stuff apparently.

for panel b, i got that there is no correlation between brain size and number of functional communities. i thought it would scale positively with each other but what do i know.
the figure2_panelb plot is the important one. the diagnostic plots are for me to make sure im sane and my code is right. here is some literature supporting my findings.
Key Literature:
Herculano-Houzel (2016)

The Human Advantage: A New Understanding of How Our Brain Became Remarkable (MIT Press).

Key point: Challenges the assumption that absolute brain size correlates with cognitive ability, emphasizing neuronal density and connectivity patterns instead.

Barton & Venditti (2014)

Nature Communications: "Rapid Evolution of the Cerebellum in Humans and Other Great Apes."

Finding: Cerebellar expansion (not just neocortex size) is linked to cognitive traits, suggesting functional reorganization matters more than total brain mass.

Hofman (2014)

Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: "Evolution of the Human Brain: When Bigger is Better."

Conclusion: While brain size scales with some functional capacities, modularity and network efficiency (not size alone) drive cognitive complexity.

cherry pick what whatever works. just have it be related to mammals.
